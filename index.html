                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Fabian Tobar. I am a student of the video game development technology program at
                    Sena in the virtual modality, my group is 2854752, and my English
                    instructor is Luisa Grajales. On this occasion, I will talk about my opinions regarding performance
                    in the labor and academic fields.
                    <br>
                    First of all, I believe that what you must have for this career, or any other, is passion.
                    Everything must start from there. I say this because you will have to face increasingly larger
                    challenges, and your attitude will determine how you deal with them. If you have to do something you
                    haven't done before, you should start with autonomous research work that will then allow you to
                    choose the best option to meet your requirements.
                    <br>
                    You must take the time to understand the problem, but you also have to do it quickly. You should
                    learn to filter out unhelpful information and recognize reliable sources. You should not give in to
                    requirements that are beyond the limits of your job, but this also greatly depends on your
                    relationship with your employer and your connection to the company's goals.
                    <br>
                    You must always be grateful to your employer, and if things get out of control, you should be better
                    than everyone else and use communication. Passion and communication should be your guiding
                    principles.
                    <br>
                    Well, that's my opinion on this topic. Thank you for listening, and until next time.

                <h3><span>Gabe Newell: A Game-Changer</span> in the Tech World</h3>
                <h4>GA2-240202501-AA1-EV03</h4>
                <img height="315" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RVzbiZdLqZ8hj6rLXUK9Yd-900-80.jpg"
                    alt="Coding Image" />

                <p>
                    Gabe Newell, born on November 3 in 1962, in Seattle, Washington emerged as a significant figure in
                    video game technology. After pursuing Computer Science at Harvard University, he embarked on a
                    journey that reshaped the gaming landscape.
                    </br></br>
                    Following a stint at Microsoft, Newell alongside Mike Harrington founded the Valve Corporation in
                    1996, marking the genesis of a transformative era in gaming.
                    </br></br>
                    At Valve, Newell played a pivotal role in redefining how gamers interacted with and acquired video
                    games. As the co-founder and president he fostered an environment conducive to innovation,
                    empowering developers to create groundbreaking titles.
                    </br></br>
                    Notably, Newell's leadership was characterized by a refreshing blend of intellect and humility.
                    Unlike traditional corporate executives, he engaged directly with the gaming community, fostering a
                    sense of camaraderie and accessibility.
                    </br></br>
                    Throughout his illustrious career, Newell spearheaded numerous initiatives that propelled gaming
                    into new realms of possibility. Chief among these was the creation of Steam, a revolutionary
                    platform that streamlined the process of purchasing and playing games on personal computers.
                    </br></br>
                    In addition to Steam, Newell spearheaded ambitious projects such as SteamOS and Steam Machines,
                    envisioning a future where gaming transcended traditional boundaries.
                    </br></br>
                    The impact of Newell extended beyond infrastructure to the realm of game development, where he
                    helmed the creation of iconic titles like Half-Life, Portal, and Dota 2. Those games not only
                    captivated audiences with their immersive storytelling but also showcased the visionary approach of
                    Newell to game design.
                    </br></br>
                    Moreover, Newell's commitment to democratizing gaming was evident in his efforts to support indie
                    developers and ensure the accessibility of Steam to gamers worldwide.
                    </br></br>
                    As we reflect on the legacy of Newell, it becomes evident that his contributions have left an
                    indelible mark on the gaming industry. His visionary leadership and dedication to innovation
                    continue to shape the future of gaming, inspiring generations of developers and alike enthusiasts.
                    </br></br>
                    In the end, Gabe Newell has made a huge difference in how we play video games. He is all about
                    making gaming fun for everyone, and that is why he is such a big deal in the tech world.

                <p>The game's story follows a scientist named Hans, who lives in the year 2023 and discovers that he is
                    a direct descendant of one of the German authors whose works were burned in 1933. While working on
                    his research, Hans discovers a unique ability: ability to materialize literary information in
                    physical objects.
                    <br>
                    Determined to do something to prevent the destruction of his ancestor's works, Hans travels back in
                    time using a time machine he built himself. He arrives just after sunset on the day of the Nazi book
                    burning in 1933, when it is just beginning. With his unique ability, Hans sets out to stop the book
                    burning at all costs.
                    <br>
                    As the player takes the role of Hans, he must fight hordes of Nazis in a series of first-person
                    shooter missions. Using his unique ability, Hans creates weapons and items from the literary
                    information he has in his book. The player must use these weapons to outmaneuver enemies and
                    complete key quests to avoid book burning.
                    <br>
                    As the game progresses, the player finds out more about his ability and uses it to fight against the
                    Nazi regime. The Nazis are becoming more numerous and skilled, and the player must adapt and improve
                    his skills to defeat them.
                    <br>
                    The game ends with a final grand battle to prevent the burning of books, where the player must use
                    all of his abilities to defeat the Nazi forces and save his ancestor's works and those of other
                    authors. If the player manages to avoid burning, a final boss is unlocked that will use all his
                    power to carry out his fateful mission.
